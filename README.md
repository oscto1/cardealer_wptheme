## Car dealer theme | Wordpress
### Â¡Hi!
This is a clean WordPress theme that I made as an assessment for a job proposal.
You can add new cars and brands and also customize the cars fields with [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).
You can also filter the cars by brand.

## To add icons to the brand taxonomy
You gotta add the path to the image in the description with the following format:

So the table looks something like this:

*I let those sample on the images folder if you want to try.*

## To add a car properly
It's necessary to install [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), and add the following fields, It's also important that the required fields stay the way they are:

And the Brand select with this format:

Having the left part equal to the slug of the brand taxonomy.
